abstract = {Endogenous growth models typically assume that innovations are protected solely by patents. Consequently, they predict that strengthening patent protection stimulates innovation by increasing the private return to R&D. This contrasts with empirical evidence that: (1) firms routinely employ a combination of patents and secrecy and (2) stronger patent regimes have been associated with increased patenting but not increased innovation, a finding referred to as the “patent puzzle.” In this paper, I develop a novel model of endogenous growth that is consistent with this evidence. Successful innovators’ choose an appropriation strategy in the form of a patent, secrecy mix. Both protection methods are imperfect, and innovators face a trade-off between secrecy’s superior protection against imitation and patenting’s protection against rival innovation. I demonstrate that growth oriented policy changes generate important economic effects through their impact on the endogenous appropriation strategies of innovators.}
